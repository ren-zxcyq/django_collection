# 2) we add the "inlines" attribute to the BookAdmin admin.ModelAdmin class
# These 2 add an inline block in the Book Details View.

    # 1) (catalog/models.py) - In the Book Class defined a function to get the info as a string
    #                           display_genre()
    # 2) (catalog/models.py) - In the Book Class define the attribute
    #                           display_genre - which returns output of the above function.

    #   def display_genre(self):

    # of the database operation.

    # very useful for other reasons â€” for example to add a Delete link next to every
    # item in the list.
