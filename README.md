# Notes

## Run the server (Development ONLY)
By default it will serve the site to your local computer (http://127.0.0.1:8000/), but you can also specify other computers on your network to serve to

`python3 manage.py runserver`

## Update Models
Run the following commands to define tables or change the db tables whenever you change something in the models.
- python3 manage.py makemigrations
- python3 manage.py migrate

Optional can specify app name, in order to migrate only the given apps Models etc.
- python3 manage.py makemigrations catalog

## Models - Important:
- Models define the structure of stored data.
- including field types & possibly their max size, def vals, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms etc.
- Models are implemented as subclasses of:	django.db.models.Model

- An Example:
	`from django.db import models

	class MyModelName(models.Model):
		"""A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""

		# Fields
		my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
		...

		# Metadata
		class Meta: 
			ordering = ['-my_field_name']

		# Methods
		def get_absolute_url(self):
			"""Returns the url to access a particular instance of MyModelName."""
			return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])
		
		def __str__(self):
			"""String for representing the MyModelName object (in Admin site etc.)."""
			return self.my_field_name`

- When used in a form, my_field_name would be My field name

### Common Field Arguments
- help_text	-	Label for HTML forms
- verbose_name	-	name for the field, used in Field Labels
- default	-	Default Value
- null		-	If True, store blank vals as NULL. (CharField will be stored as an empty string) Def: False
- blank		-	If True, is allowed to be blank in forms. Def: False, meaning you will be forced to provide a val. (Often used with null=True)
- choices	-	A group of choices for this field. Default form widget will be a select box with these choices.
- primary_key	-	If True, sets the current field as the primary key for the model. If no field is specified, Django will add a field automatically (named: id)

### Common Field Types
- CharField	-	Must specify max_length
- TextField	-	Arbitrary length, may specify max_length
- IntegerField	-	Storing int vals, and for validating entered values as ints in forms.
- DateField	-	datetime.date
- DateTimeField	-	datetime.datetime	objects.
			- auto_now=True - declare to set to the curr date whenever the model is saved
			- auto_now_add - to only set the date when the model is first created
			- default - set a def date that can be overriden by the user
- EmailField	-	store & validate
- FileField	-
- ImageField	-	upload files & images.
			- Simply adds validation that the uploaded file is an image.
			- They both have params that define how & where the uploaded files are stored.
- AutoField	-	IntegerField that automatically increments.
			- A PK of this type is automatically added to ur model if you don't specify one.
- ForeignKey	-	specify a one-to-many relationship to another db model.
			- the "one" side represents the model that contains the "key"
- ManyToManyField	specify a many-to-many relationship
			- param on_delete -> specify what happens when the associated record is deleted
				- (e.g. a val of models.SET_NULL would simply set the vall to NULL)
- etc: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/fields/#field-types


## Metadata
- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/options/
- ordering = ['title', '-pubdate'] or ['-my_field_name']	-	Ordering upon querying
- verbose_name = 'BetterName'
- define access permissions	- different than the ones assigned by default
- declare a model class as abstract	- will allow the Model to be used for other Models (and prevent storing records)
- others control how data are stored; they can be used to map the model to a different db that already exists


## Methods
- __str__()		-	Should be defined on every model. Represent individual records in the Admin site.
- get_absolute_url()	-	(usually) URL displays individual model records. (Automatically adds a "View on Site" button to the model's editing screens in the Admin site.
- any other method

## Model Management

- Create & Modify Record
	- Create a new record using the model's constructor
	`record = MyModelName(my_field_name="Instance No1")`

	- Save the object into the db.
	`record.save()`

	- Access the fields using dot syntax
	`print(record.id)	# Should return 1 for the first record.
	print(record.my_field_name)	# Should print 'Instance No1'

	- Save the modified record
	`record.my_field_name = "New Instance Name"
	record.save()`

- Searching for records
	-	Can retrieve records for a model as a QuerySet. (iterable object)	objects.all()
	`all_books = Book.objects.all()`

	-	Filter the returned QuerySet (text or numeric field).
	`wild_books = Book.objects.filter(title__contains='wild')
	number_wild_books = wild_books.count()`

-	In general filtering happens like this:
	-	field_name__match_type
	-	field_name__field_name__match_type
		Will match on: Fiction, Science fiction, non-fiction etc.
			`books_containing_genre = Book.objects.filter`
		(genre__name__icontains='fiction')
	-	match_type can be:
			-	contains	Case-Sensitive
			-	icontains	insensitive
			-	iexact		insensitive exact match
			-	exact
			-	in, gt
			-	startswith
			-	https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/querysets/#field-lookups
	-	There is a lot more you can do with queries, including backwards searches from related models, chaining filters, returning a smaller set of values etc. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/queries/
